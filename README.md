# Types of Variation üß¨
Exploring the world of continuous and discontinuous variations.

## What it is ‚ùì
This is a website about an experiment for *continuous* and *discontinuous* variations. It collects data for continuous and discontinuous features, like your height and bloodtype. I've also implemented a 'age' factor, which by hovering the chart, users can see the age range and average age for each catagory.

## Idea üí°
I got this idea while reviewing my Biology textbook. It seemed pretty nice to do this experiment whilst learning about databases. This is also my first time using Supabase.

# Code Stuff ü§ì
Here's a section where a yap about the code, so I can refresh my memories about them.

## Supabase ‚öôÔ∏è
I've used Supabase to store all the info for the experiment. For the table, recorded data are `id`, `age`, `height/bloodtype` and `time`. I've learned a lot through this project, and this will definately help me in the future.

## Filter and Cookies üç™
Too prevent spamming and fake information, some filters were made to prevent information such as too *unbelieveable* values (such as negative height or non-human age). To not have dulplicates from same people, there's a cookie that could track if you've done the survey. It could be bypassed easily, though, by just deleting cookies.
