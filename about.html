            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                By collecting data all over the world, we can plot it in a graph and see how different factors affect
                the distribution of traits. This experiment will help understand how continuous and discontinuous
                variations work.

            <h2>Continuous Variation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Continuous variation</b> is the variation in which the differences in the characteristic is not distinct.</li>
                <li>If the data is obtained and plotted on a graph, a <b>normal distribution</b> or a <b>bell-shaped curve</b> will be obtained.</li>
                <li>Why? This is because most members of the population have intermediate phenotypes, which are characteristics found in between the two extremes.</li>
                <li>Continuous variation is <b>quantitative</b>, it can be measured and graded from one extreme to the other extreme.</li>
                <li>The characteristics are influenced by environmental factors. Examples of characteristics which show continuous variation are <b>height, body, weight</b> and <b>skin color.</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Discontinuous Variation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Discontinuous variation</b> shows distinct differences in characteristic.</li>
                <li>If data is obtained and plotted on a graph, a <b>discrete distribution</b> or a bar chart with separate bars are obtained. There are no intermediate characteristics.</li>
                <li>The characteristic is <b>qualitative</b>, it cannot be measured or graded because the characteristic can only be determined by genetic factors.</li>
                <li>The characteristic is not influenced by environmental factors.</li>
                <li>Occurrence of discontinuous variation is due to genetic factors, therefore it can be inherited.</li>
                <li>A characteristic is determined by a single gene with two or three alleles. Therefore, the characteristic is easily seen.</li>
                <li>Examples of discontinuous variations are the <b>ability to roll tongue, eye color</b> and <b>fingerprint pattern.</b></li>
