# Types of Variation: the experiment
Utilising SQL database to collect data and obtain graph, simillar to page 258/259 in Biology DLP Form 5 Textbook. This experiment shows the two types of variations, which are continuous variation and discontinuous variation, and we discuss their differences.

## Pages
- Continuous variation
A page where people can enter their height, it will get added to the database which updates the graph, in the page. After that, cookie stops it from uploading. (Prevent multiple response). "If the data is obtained and plotted on a graph, a **normal distribution** or a **bell-shaped curve** will be obtained." -> Dropdown (I forgot the tag), explanation of such behaviour.

- Discontinuous variation
Same with continuous, but graph -> discrete distribution
